    content: <><p>Once upon a time there was a billionaire. This guy had reached the true elite; he’d achieved epic results in both his professional and personal spheres. He became the kind of person you can’t help but admire. Someone who you knew would leave a positive legacy for the world.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So, what was his secret? Did he have a natural talent that helped him succeed? Nope – it wasn’t natural talent. Were his accomplishments the result of hard work and grit. No, not that either.</p>
    <p>As you may have gathered form the title of these blinks, this billionaire attributed all his success to a simple, yet revolutionary morning routine.</p>
    <p>Every day, our billionaire would rise at 5:00 a.m. And after waking, he’d follow a little known formula designed to turbocharge his mental focus, build his physical fitness and encourage him to be his best self day in and day out.</p>
    <p>Would you like to know this morning routine? It's time to take you through the main ideas of Robin Sharma’s The 5 AM Club.&nbsp;</p>

    title: 'A chance meeting drew a disillusioned entrepreneur and a frustrated artist to the secrets of the 5 AM club.',
    content: <><p>In these blinks, we’ll follow the fictitious tale of a curious group of people: A depressed entrepreneur, in need of revitalization; a frustrated artist, trying to refuel his creativity and develop a legacy; and a billionaire with a string of successes behind him and a desire to pass on the knowledge of how to live an extraordinary life.</p>
    <p>The three met at a personal optimization conference addressed by a legendary business guru, the Spellbinder, someone renowned for his ability to weave magic and captivate his audience with the power of his insights. The billionaire approached the entrepreneur and the artist after the Spellbinder’s speech had finished but they didn’t know that he was a billionaire. The billionaire was disguised as a poor man, a habit he had developed to remind himself that money isn’t everything. The only clue to his actual wealth was his expensive watch. The impoverished-looking billionaire told the two that he’d made a fortune thanks to the Spellbinder, who’d taught him that while many people wish that extraordinary things will happen to them, truly elite performers learn that they can make extraordinary things happen themselves.</p>
    <p>The entrepreneur and the artist became more and more curious about this mysterious man who talked like he was a guru himself. They listened as the billionaire explained how the Spellbinder –&nbsp;who, in fact, was the billionaire’s personal mentor –&nbsp;had taught him one thing that was more important than anything else.</p>
    <p>What was it? That the most reliable way to generate the best results in your personal and professional life is to build a world-beating morning routine. Being a generous man, the billionaire made an incredible offer. If the entrepreneur and artist wanted to come hang with him at his beach house in Mauritius, he would teach them the secrets of a world-class morning routine. All they needed to do was meet the next morning at 5:00 a.m.</p>
    <p>The entrepreneur and the artist were a little skeptical the next morning, but it started to soften when a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce collected them and delivered them to a hangar containing a sleek, ivory-colored private jet, which bore the logo: “5AC.”</p>
    <p>The entrepreneur asked the chauffeur what the logo meant, and he explained that it stood for “The 5 AM Club.” And so began their journey toward understanding a revolutionary morning routine and a whole new outlook on life with the potential to transform everything for the better.</p>
    <p>Early the next morning, the billionaire told the entrepreneur and artist how getting up at 5:00 a.m. was the way he had learned to escape mediocrity and achieve greatness. Getting up at 5:00 a.m. had promoted his creativity, doubled his energy, and tripled his productivity. How?</p>
    <p>Well, the billionaire told them, many true greats throughout history, from novelist John Grisham to composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, have understood that the isolation that comes from getting up at 5:00 a.m. has a multiplying effect.</p></>

    content: <><p>All of us have limited mental capacity or <em>cognitive bandwidth</em>. And throughout the day, our attention is given to more and more things: work, the news, interaction with others and social media. Our bandwidth gets used up by all of these so, by lunchtime, we can’t really concentrate on anything at all. By constantly shifting our focus from one thing to another, we give nothing enough attention. But if you get up at 5:00 a.m., you have a golden opportunity to focus on one high-value activity without your brain getting distracted.</p><p>This focus is further enhanced by the concept of<em> transient hypofrontality</em>, which means, in a nutshell, that at 5:00 a.m., you are well placed to achieve a state of <em>flow</em> in your thinking.</p></>
